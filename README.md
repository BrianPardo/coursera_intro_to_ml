## Python and Matlab solutions to Coursera's machine learning course
### Solutions by Brian Pardo

This repository contains solutions to the original machine learning course offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The original problem sets were given in octave. I have reimplemented the original problems in python as a learning exercise. The exercises are as follows:

1. Linear regression with one or more variables
2. Logistic regression and regularization
3. Multi-class classification and neural networks
4. Training neural networks
5. Regularized linear regression and the bias vs. variance tradeoff
6. Support vector machines
7. $K$-Means clustering and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis
8. Anomaly detection and recommender systems using collaborative filtering
